Question Subject Line: CSC 275 Online Lab 9 Question

Create a program that keeps track of specific information for Students. The information stored should be the following:
First Name, Last Name, Major, GPA, UIN, NetID, Age, Gender,
For this simple program we will only need to store 10 students in an ArrayList. Your students should be stored in an object called Student.
You should be able to add, display, remove, save and load Students in the ArrayList.
You should submit for grading 2 files: Lab9Driver.java and Student.java
Hint: It’s MUCH easier to build your save method first, then cater your load method to how you’ve determined to save it.
